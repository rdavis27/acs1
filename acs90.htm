<h1>Exploring Census Data using OCC1990 via R Shiny</h1>

The Census <A HREF="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/news/data-releases/2017/release-schedule.html">released</A> the 2017 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year microdata file on October 18, 2018.  It was made available through <A HREF="https://usa.ipums.org/usa/">IPUMS USA</A> in early November.  An <A HREF="https://econdata.shinyapps.io/acs90/">R Shiny application</A> uses this and other data extracted from IPUMS USA to explore Census data from 2017 and earlier.  For occupations, it uses the variable OCC1990 so that it can compare workers in the same occupations back to 1950.  The <A HREF="">description of OCC1990 begins as follows</A>:
<p><b>
OCC1990 is a modified version of the 1990 Census Bureau occupational classification scheme. OCC1990 provides researchers with a consistent classification of occupations using the 1990 coding scheme as its starting point. It spans the period from 1950 forward.
</b><p>
Following is a list of the extracted variables, including those for the years of 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017:

Due to memory constraints, the <A HREF="https://econdata.shinyapps.io/acs90/">current online version of the app</A> only includes 2010 and 2017 at present.  This may be expanded in the future.  Still, since the online app currently includes just two years, this document will focus mainly on looking at a single year's data.
<p>
From the variables listed above, RACE, HISPAN, BPL, EDUC, DEGFIELD, DEGFIELD2, EMPSTAT, and CLASSWKR each include an additional detailed variable with the same name with a D added.  For example RACE will have a detailed version named RACED.  Hence, the 28 variable selected for 2017 above will actually result in 36 variables, including the 8 detailed variables.

# = selected, p = preselected, a = added automatically, c = created from lookups
</pre>
The # symbol denotes the variables that were manually selected and the p and a symbols that were automatically preselected or selected in response to the manual selections.  The last three variables marked with the symbol c were created by using the STATEFIP, COUNTY, and MET2013 to look up the text representations of states, counties, and metropolitan areas in the indicated files.
<p>
When the <A HREF="https://econdata.shinyapps.io/acs90/">acs90 application</A> first starts, it defaults to the following screen:
<p>
<img src="http://econdataus.com/acs90o1.png" height="75%" width="75%" alt="acs90 screen 1 output">
<p>
As can be seen, the screen has four tabs (Output, Plot, Map, and Usage) and is initially set to the Output tab.  It displays a table that shows the education level in 2017 of workers with the occupation "Computer software developers (229)" in all counties of California with 5000 or more workers.  The format and contents of the table are determined by the default input in the left sidepanel:
<pre>

</pre>
The inputs labelled 'Search STATE', 'COUNTY', and 'METRO' can be used to filter these fields.  Hence, the CA in the 'Select STATE' input causes only metro areas in California to be displayed.  The data is also filtered by the selection of 5000 in the input labelled 'Minimum Count'.  This causes only those metro areas with 5,000 or more of the specified workers to be listed.
<p>
The input labelled 'Occupation' can be set to the major occupation groups shown at <A HREF="https://usa.ipums.org/usa/volii/occ1990.shtml">this link</A> which are in the data.  The data for the <A HREF="https://econdata.shinyapps.io/acs90/">acs90 application</A> is currently limited to this subset of occupations due to memory issues on the server but may be expanded if possible.  The occupation select list also includes some subgroups of these major groups such as "Computer software developers (229).  That is what the occupation is set to by default.
<p>
The input labelled "Employment status' can be set to filter the workers shown.  It can be currently set to 'All', 'Employed', 'Unemployed', and 'In labor force'.  This last selection includes all workers, including those not in the labor force.
<p>
The input labelled 'Group by' is the key way of selecting the columns for the table.  In this case, the columns are obtained by grouping the workers by their education level (EDUCATION).  The categories for EDUCATION are "Bachelor-", Masters", and "Phd+" to indicate workers with a Bachelor's degree or less, a Master's degree, or a Phd degree or higher.  The third column with the header 'Count' will always contain the total count for the columns to the right of it.
<p>
In the default output, the fourth column and up contain percentages of the total count for each column.  Hence, these numbers will add up to 100 percent, discounting any round-off error.  This output of percents is set by the input labelled 'Units' which is set to 'Percent'.  Setting this to 'Percent in group' will have a different affect if the 'Group by' input contains more than one selection.  Selecting 'Count' for units will change the output of these columns to the actual counts.  Then, their sum will add up to the total count shown in the third column.
<p>
The input labelled 'Sort column' specifies the column by which the rows should be sorted.  Since it's set to 4, the rows are sorted by the fourth column.  Setting it to a minus number counts the columns from the right.  Hence, a setting it to -1 causes the rows to be sorted by the last column.  The radio buttons labelled 'Ascending' and 'Descending' beneath this input will cause the sorting to be ascending or descending, respectively.  Finally, the input labelled 'Decimal places' will set the number of decimals to use when the units is in percents.  For units of 'Count', no decimal places are required.
<p>
Below the table are shown the URL parameters which can be used to obtain this page, along with the inputs.  Since no parameters are listed for the short format, this page can be obtained via a URL <A HREF="https://econdata.shinyapps.io/acs17/">https://econdata.shinyapps.io/acs17/</A>.  The long format lists all of the parameters and can be copied to make a record of all of the inputs, even the defaults.  However, this link could likewise be obtained using these parameters.  Note: The parameters may not have been updated to include all possible parameters but will likely be updated to include them soon.
<p>
Selecting the Plot tab, will display the following plot:
<p>

<p>
Currently, the "Plot Type" can be set to "Bar Plot" or "Line Graph".
<p>
Selecting the Map tab, will display the following plot:

This map corresponds to the following data shown on the Output tab:
<pre>

10 2017   Santa Clara County CA 90,412      42.4    48.3  9.3
</pre>
As can be seen, Riverside County ia red since 89.8 percent of its software developers have Bachelor's degrees or less.  Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco, and Orange counties are orange since the percentage of their software developers with a Bachelor's degree or less is 73.4, 72.8, 71.5, and 69.7, respectively.  San Diego County is yellow-green since its percentage is 63.9 percent and Contra Costa, San Mateo, and Alameda counties are green with percentages of 56.8, 53.4, and 53.0, respectively.  Finally, Santa Clara County is light blue since only 42.4 of its software developers have Bachelor's degrees or less.
<p>
You can look at counties with just 1,000 or more software developers by going to the Output tab and changing "Minimum Count" to 1000.  This will expand the number of counties from 10 to 25 (including (NA) for records for which no county was specified).  Clicking the "Ascending" radio button will then display the following rows, sorted from the lowest to highest values of Bachelor's degrees or less:

Going back to the Map tab then shows the following map:
<p>
<img src="http://econdataus.com/acs90m1k.png" alt="acs90 screen 1 map for counties of 1000 or more">
<p>
As can be seen, more counties are now colored.  Also, the range of the color legend has now changed since the percentages now range from 100.0 to 42.4 percent rather than from 89.8 to 42.4 percent as before.  As a result, Riverside County is now brown instead of red and it is Kern County that is red.
<p>
One problem with the above map and table is that they are focused on the percentage of software developers who have a Bachelor's degree or less rather than a Master's degree or more.  This is because the program is currently coded to focus on any one category of a currently defined grouping and the EDUCATION grouping has the categories Bachelor (and below), Masters, and Phd (and above).  It would likely be clearer and more positive to focus on the latter.  This was accomplished by creating a new grouping called Masters with the categories Bachelor and below and Masters and above.  Then switching to the Output tab, setting "Group by" to MASTERS and changing "Sort column" to 5 (to select the Masters or above category) will output the following table:

<p>
This is likely much more clear as it focuses on the percentage of software developers with a Master's degree and above.  In any case, the precise appearance of the prior maps is affected by the values of the inputs following inputs in the left sidepanel:
<p>
<pre>
Input Label         Default                                         Description
------------------  ----------------------------------------------  -----------
Min Pop             200000                                          Minimum population of cities to display. Lowering this will increase the number of cities displayed.
Long Offset         0.5                                             This will set the approximate offset to the left of the city dot that the city name will appear (in units of longitude).
Cities to Skip      Oakland,Long Beach                              This default for California suppressed the display of Oakland and Long Beach which overwrote other city names.
Cities to Show      Santa Barbara,Santa Rosa,San Rafael,Santa Cruz  This default for California adds additional cities which have less than the population specified by "Min Pop"
Map Colors          lightblue1,green,yellow,orange,red              This sets the range of colors used.
Include State(s)    True(checked)                                   This will cause the entire state (or states for a U.S. map) to display. If unchecked, only the specified counties are displayed.
</pre>
Going back to the Output tab, blanking out the "Search State" field, and returning to the Map tab will display the following map of the entire United States:
<p>
<img src="http://econdataus.com/acs90m2us.png" alt="acs90 screen 1 map for counties of 1000 or more in U.S.">
<p>
As can be seen, most of the counties are colored white.  This is because they contain less than 1000 software developers as determined by the survey.  Fortunately, it's also possible to look at the percentages by state.  Go back to the Output tab and change "Geography" to STATE.  This will display a table of 49 of the 50 states plus Washington D.C.  To get the missing two states, change "Minimum Count" to 500.  The following table of all 50 states plus Washing D.C. will display:

As can be seen Alaska (AK) and Wyoming (WY) had 806 and 877 software developers in 2017, respectively.  Going back to the Map tab will display the following map of the entire United States:
<p>
<img src="http://econdataus.com/acs90m3us.png" alt="acs90 screen 1 map for counties of 1000 or more in U.S.">
<p>
As can be seen, all of the states are colored according to the percentage of its software developers who have a Bachelor's degree or less.  Of course, Alaska and Wyoming would have been white if "Minimum Count" had been left set to 1,000.  Still, it does seem to be more useful to look at a relatively small population, like software developers, by state when looking at the entire United States.
